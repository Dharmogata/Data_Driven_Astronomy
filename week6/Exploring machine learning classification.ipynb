    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will using machine learning to classify galaxies into three types (ellipticals, spirals or galactic mergers) based on their observed properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last activity you had a go at classifying galaxies by hand on the Galaxy Zoo website which hopefully gave you some intuition for the dataset and how we can distinguish between the different types of galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our machine learning experiments, we are using the crowd-classified classes from Galaxy Zoo as the training data for our automatic decision tree classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by looking at how classification differs from regression. We will then implement some of the new features and parameters that we will use to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We will also show you how to measure accuracy for classification problems, before extending our classifier to use random forests."

    "## Classification vs Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, the predictions are from a fixed set of classes, whereas in regression the prediction typically corresponds to a continuum of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, we measure accuracy by looking at the size of the differences between the predicted values and the actual values. In contrast, in classification problems a prediction can either be correct or incorrect. This makes measuring the accuracy of our model a lot simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation using decision trees, there is very little difference between classification and regression. The only notable difference is that our targets are classes rather than real values. When calculating the accuracy, we check whether the predicted class matches as the actual class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on decision tree regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In decision tree regression, the possible outputs are a finite set of values that correspond to the number of leaves/end points in the tree. Ideally we want as many points as possible to give a good approximation of the 'continuous' parameter space, whilst avoiding overfitting."

    "## Selecting features\n",
    "The features that we will be using to do our galaxy classification are colour index, adaptive moments, eccentricities and concentrations. These features are provided as part of the SDSS catalogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Colour indices are the same colours (u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z) we used for regression. Studies of galaxy evolution tell us that spiral galaxies have younger star populations and therefore are 'bluer' (brighter at lower wavelengths). Elliptical galaxies have an older star population and are brighter at higher wavelengths ('redder').\n",
    "\n",
    "Eccentricity approximates the shape of the galaxy by fitting an ellipse to its profile. Eccentricity is the ratio of the two axis (semi-major and semi-minor). The De Vaucouleurs model was used to attain these two axis. To simplify our experiments, we will use the median eccentricity across the 5 filters."

    "Adaptive moments also describe the shape of a galaxy. They are used in image analysis to detect similar objects at different sizes and orientations. We use the fourth moment here for each band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concentration is similar to the luminosity profile of the galaxy, which measures what proportion of a galaxy's total light is emitted within what radius. A simplified way to represent this is to take the ratio of the radii containing 50% and 90% of the Petrosian flux.\n",

So in our current problem, one tree might be trained using eccentricity and another using concentration and the 4th adaptive moment. By using different combinations of input features you create expert trees that are can better identify classes by a given feature.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we have used decision tree classifiers to identify a galaxies type by a selection of derived features (e.g. eccentricity and concentration).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learnt that asessing the models performance is a lot simpler with classification than it is with regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion matrices can be a useful tool to help understand where our model is over and under preforming with respect to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started out with the goal of using decision trees to classify galaxies as one of three types. We found that we were able to achieve an accuracy of around 80% using decision trees which is very good when you consider the statistical accuracy of a random selection is 33% and the naive approach using only pixel values yielded ~64%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to improve on the accuracy of the decision tree classifier by using a selection of them in ensemble learning with a random forest."
